# Prediction-Classification-and-Clustering-on-Public-Expenses-Dataset

So, I used a public expenses dataset, and applied a simple end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline on it. The pipeline included exploratory data analysis to get to know data more, basic data preprocessing to make the dataset feasible enough to be feeded into any model, and at last did REGRESSION to predict one feature's value, did CLASSIFICATION to classify one feature, and did K-MEANS CLUSTERING to do cluster analysis for optimal number of clusters and finally clustering the data.

The reason of such poor results is the bad selection of feature for classification. I wanted to see if classifying GENDER based on this data can work but given these results, it's evident that the dataset is fair enough and is not biased towards any gender.
